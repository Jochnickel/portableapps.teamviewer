Part I
General provisions


1. General content of the contract



1.1.

Parties and subject matter. The provisions of this End User License Agreement (EULA) shall govern the relationship between TeamViewer Germany GmbH, Jahnstr. 30, 73037 Göppingen, Germany ("TeamViewer") and its customers ("Customer") with respect to the licensing by TeamViewer of certain of its software and the provision by TeamViewer of certain services. Accordingly, subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, TeamViewer may provide Customer with (i) certain software installed on computers of the Customer as well as accessed and used via web browser, and apps for mobile terminals (e.g. iOS, Android) that enable the remote maintenance of computers, video based remote assistance and the performance of online meetings including diverse features (collectively "Software"), (ii) servers for the establishment of encrypted connections (handshake) and for the forwarding of data packets (routing) in connection with the use of the Software ("Server Services"), and (iii) related support services ("Support Services"). The Server Services and the Support Services are collectively referred to herein as "Services".


1.2.

Formation and content of the contract for Subscription and Perpetual licenses. A paid contract pursuant to this EULA for Subscription and Perpetual Software licenses shall be formed, if (i) the Customer consummates the web-based order process on the TeamViewer website (www.teamviewer.com) and, at the end, clicks on the "Purchase" / "Order" / "Subscribe" or similarly named button after having accepted this EULA, or if (ii) the Customer and TeamViewer sign a written order form which references this EULA, or if (iii) the Customer orders by phone and receives an order confirmation attaching the EULA by e-mail. Details regarding the contract (e.g. selected Software, scope of functions, price, term, Services, etc.), will be set forth in the options selected by the Customer from the specifications provided by TeamViewer during the ordering process, or respectively on the order form (hereinafter all consistently referred to as "Order", and hereinafter this EULA and the Order together shall be referred to as the "Paid Contract").


1.3.

Formation and content of the contract for Free Version. A free-of-charge contract pursuant to this EULA shall also be formed between TeamViewer and the Customer if the Customer downloads the Free Version, configures the type of use and installs the Free Version after having accepted this EULA (hereinafter referred to as the "Freemium Contract", and a Freemium Contract or Paid Contract, referred to as a "Contract").


1.4.

Users of the Software and/or Services under a Customer's license. The provisions of A. Part I of this EULA shall apply accordingly to those users who are using the Software and/or Services under a Customer's license, e.g. in case of a corporate Customer with a Software license which includes a use of the Customer's and/or its affiliates' employees or representatives. Any such user acknowledges and agrees that its use of the Software and/or Services is subject to the Customer's license and that TeamViewer may, on behalf and upon instruction of the Customer, restrict or prevent the user from making use of the Customer's license.


1.5.

Trial Use. Prior to entering into a Paid Contract, TeamViewer may provide the Customer with the opportunity of a trial use for the Software and the Server Services during a defined trial use period (the "Trial Use"). TeamViewer also provides the Customer with a limited Trial Use license if the Customer installs the Free Version and declares that its use of the Software is (at least partly) for commercial purposes. For any Trial Use, this EULA shall also apply.


1.6.

No deviating provisions. The Contract, including all Orders thereto, contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all proposals, understandings, representations, warranties, covenants, and any other communications (whether written or oral) between the parties relating thereto and is binding upon the parties and their permitted successors and assigns. Any inconsistent or conflicting terms and conditions contained in any purchase order or similar instrument of Customer shall be of no force or effect, unless TeamViewer has explicitly approved such terms and conditions in writing. This requirement of explicit approval applies in any case, regardless of whether TeamViewer provides Software or Services to the Customer in knowledge of the Customer's general terms and conditions without explicitly objecting to them.


1.7.

Electronic commerce obligations. Sections 312i para. 1 nos. 1, 2 and 3 as well as section 312i para. 1 sentence 2 German Civil Code ("BGB"), which specify certain obligations of TeamViewer in the case of electronic commerce contracts, shall not apply.


1.8.

Test period. If an Order provides for a test period, the Customer may terminate the Paid Contract (and its Order) for the Software within seven (7) calendar days of the conclusion of the Paid Contract. In such a case, the Customer shall be provided with a refund of any prepaid, unused fees (if any) paid to TeamViewer for the applicable Software that is subject to the test period.




2. Product specification, activation, and lifecycle of the Software



2.1.

Product specification. The functions of the Software and a description of any Services are set forth and described in the product description available on the TeamViewer website under https://www.teamviewer.com/product-descriptions/ and on the applicable Order ("Product Specification"). Only this Product Specification shall be relevant to the contractually agreed quality and features of the Software and the Services; any other oral or written statements of TeamViewer shall not be relevant. Some features and functions of the Software or Services provided by TeamViewer may include or depend on certain third-party products and services all of which may be subject to changes by such third parties. Accordingly, such features and functions may be modified or limited by TeamViewer.


2.2.

No guarantees. In case of doubt, guarantees regarding the quality or features made by TeamViewer shall only be interpreted as such if they have been made in writing (including a signature) and are labelled "guarantee".


2.3.

Provision, installation and configuration of the Software. TeamViewer shall provide the Software to the Customer for electronic download. The Customer shall be solely responsible for the installation and configuration of the Software. TeamViewer is not responsible for any installation or configuration.


2.4.

Activation of Subscription or Perpetual license. After completing the Order for a Subscription or Perpetual license, the Customer shall receive (i) a license key or (ii) an activation link for the activation of the license. Once the license key has been entered or activated, the rights of use and functionalities in accordance with the Contract shall be available to the Customer.


2.5.

Software Lifecycle Policy. Use of the Software shall be subject to TeamViewer's Software Lifecycle Policy available for download under https://dl.teamviewer.com/docs/en/TeamViewer-Software-Lifecycle-Policy-en.pdf.




3. Software rights of use



3.1.

Non-exclusive right of use. TeamViewer herewith grants the Customer the non-exclusive, worldwide (subject to applicable export regulations; unless the Customer is expressly granted a limited right to use the license only in a specific territory during the order process), non-transferrable and not sub-licensable right to install, run and use the Software on Customer's computers within the limits of the scope of use specified in the Order and/or this EULA. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, Customer shall be entitled to sublicense the Software in accordance with the applicable scope of Software functions (channel grouping).


3.2.

Term of use. In case of a Subscription, the rights of use granted under the Contract shall be limited in time to the term specified in the applicable Order (cf. section 13 below).


3.3.

Scope of use for fee-based licenses of the Software. Fee-based licenses of the Software - Subscription as well as Perpetual - are available exclusively to businesses/entrepreneurs and not to consumers. The scope of the granted rights and the admissible scope of use (e.g. channels) shall be set forth in the Contract. If the Customer obtains the right to use the Software for commercial use, then the Customer shall be entitled to use the Software for the Customer's own trade or profession or the trade or profession of Customer's Affiliates. For purposes of the foregoing, an "Affiliate" shall mean any other person which directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Customer, including, without limitation, subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. If the Customer obtains a fee-based license that includes the use of the Software and Services by its and/or its Affiliates' employees or representatives, then the Customer shall ensure that any user making use of the Customer's license complies with the terms and conditions of use set forth in this EULA. In case of any non-compliance, the Customer shall be responsible for any such user's acts and/or omissions as for its own actions and/or omissions.


3.4.

Scope of use for Free Version. The use of the Free Version is solely permitted for the Customer's own, private, non-commercial purposes (e.g. free computer support for a spouse/partner). The use of the Free Version for the exercise of the Customer's own trade or profession or the use for purposes for which the Customer directly or indirectly receives compensation (e.g. team work with colleagues, free support provided to third parties which have bought software of the Customer) does not qualify as private use.


3.5.

Unauthorized use. Any use of the Software exceeding the contractually agreed scope of usage is expressly prohibited.


3.6.

Source code. The rights of use granted shall not include any rights to the source code of the Software.


3.7.

Prohibited use. The rights granted pursuant to this EULA shall not include and the Customer shall not be entitled to and shall not allow a third party to (i) attempt to circumvent any technical devices of the Software that are directed at, or have the effect of, enforcing the terms of the EULA; (ii) modify, create derivative works, translate, decompile or create or attempt to create, by reverse engineering or otherwise, the source code or the object code of the Software; (iii) use the Software under any circumstance whatsoever directly or indirectly in a computer service business or service bureau or in a rental or commercial timesharing arrangement or as a spyware; (iv) remove, modify or obscure any copyright, trade secret, confidentiality, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights, serial number, notice, legend or similar on any copy of the Software, or related data, manuals, documentation or other materials; (v) market, sell, lend, rent, lease, or otherwise distribute, the Software or give or provide it to third parties beyond the right to sublicense the Software in accordance with section 3.1 sentence 2; or (vi) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any rights in or to the Software.
This shall not affect the Customer's statutory rights, in particular pursuant to section 69e of the German Copyright Act (UrhG).


3.8.

Reservation of rights. As between the parties, TeamViewer retains all right, title and interest in and to the Software (and any new Versions thereof provided by TeamViewer) and in all copies, modifications and derivative works of the Software including, without limitation, all rights to patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other proprietary or intellectual property rights.


3.9.

Usage analyses, right to audit and self-declaration. TeamViewer may analyse the Customer's use of the Software and Services for security reasons as well as for product improvement, license auditing and/or marketing purposes. To that end, TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, also implement technical measures regarding the functionality of the Software and the Server Services to assess whether the Customer's usage pattern is in line with the indicated usage purpose and thus with the chosen license type and to detect whether the contractually agreed scope of use is being exceeded by the Customer. Also, TeamViewer may require the Customer, at any time, to provide a self-declaration regarding its actual scope of use and/or usage pattern.




4. Services provided by TeamViewer



4.1.

Server Services. For the establishment of encrypted remote communication connections between different users of the Software, the Software must communicate with servers of TeamViewer (so-called "handshake"). In addition, it may be necessary for the transmission of data in the context of a session (e.g. online meeting or remote maintenance) that encrypted data packets be forwarded by servers of TeamViewer (so-called "routing"). Such handshake and routing are made available in connection with TeamViewer's Server Services.
TeamViewer provides the Customer with the Server Services subject to the conditions set out in this EULA. It is not part of the Server Services to safeguard an interruption- and latency-free end-to-end connection between different users of the Software. The Customer acknowledges that the Server Services may be unavailable or include latency from time to time due to technical difficulties or due to causes beyond the reasonable control of TeamViewer. Additionally, the Customer acknowledges that the end-to-end connection between different users of the Software is dependent on the Customer's internet connection to the data center as well as the Customer's use of hardware and software (e.g. PC, operating system) in compliance with system requirements for the Software (pursuant to section 7.3), all of which shall not be included in the services provided by TeamViewer and shall be Customer's responsibility. The respective costs shall be borne by Customer.


4.2.

Support Services. TeamViewer's only obligation for Support Services shall be to provide those specific Support Services set forth and described on the Order (if any), subject to Customer's payment in full for such Support Services. This shall not affect any statutory warranty claims of the Customer.




5. Documentation, Releases, Versions, interfaces, conference numbers



5.1.

Documentation. TeamViewer shall provide a PDF manual retrievable online in German and English. Any further languages may be offered by TeamViewer on a voluntary basis, at TeamViewer's sole discretion. The documentation is available under https://www.teamviewer.com/en/documents/. As between the parties, TeamViewer retains all right, title and interest in and to such documentation and in all copies, modifications and derivative works thereof including, without limitation, all rights to patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other proprietary or intellectual property rights.


5.2.

Minor Releases. TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, elect to offer minor releases of the Software for download ("Minor Releases"). The new Software version which contains the Minor Release ("Minor Release Version") may be marked by TeamViewer - in its sole discretion - by a change in the number behind the main version number (e.g. version XX.1, XX.2). Minor Release Versions may contain the correction of errors, security patches as well as minor improvements of functions (e.g. optimizations in the program execution speed) TeamViewer shall have no obligation to provide Minor Release Versions of the Software. If, however, TeamViewer does elect to provide Minor Release Versions of the Software then any Customer shall be obligated by way of a contributory duty (Mitwirkungsobliegenheit) to update the Software at its own cost to the then-current Minor Release Version of the Software as soon as reasonably practicable. All rights of use set forth herein that are applicable to the Software shall also apply to Minor Releases.


5.3.

Major Releases. TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, also elect to offer major releases of the Software for download ("Major Releases", Minor Releases and Major Releases, both a "Release"), usually comprising more extensive modifications of the Software functions. The new Software version which contains the Major Release ("Major Release Version", Minor Release Versions and Major Release Versions, both a "Version") may be marked by TeamViewer - in its sole discretion - by a change of the main version number (e.g. version XX, YY). TeamViewer shall not be obligated to provide any Major Release Versions of the Software. In the event that TeamViewer elects to provide a Major Release Version of the Software, TeamViewer may require the Customers of Perpetual licenses to pay an additional fee for use of such new Major Release Version. The Customers of Subscription licenses and Free Version shall be obligated by way of a contributory duty (Mitwirkungsobliegenheit) to upgrade to the new Major Release Version as soon as reasonably practicable. All rights of use set forth herein that are applicable to the Software shall also apply to Major Releases.


5.4.

Programming interfaces. At TeamViewer's discretion, the Software or Server Services may provide programming interfaces or other software interfaces ("API") which may include applications of third parties or of the Customer ("Third-party Software") that can communicate with the Software or respectively the servers of TeamViewer. TeamViewer may change or switch off APIs at any time without any obligation or liability to Customer. The respective provider shall be responsible for the Third-party Software. The provisions of the Contract shall not apply to any such Third-party Software and TeamViewer shall have no liability for any Third-party Software.


5.5.

Telephone conference number. If, in the context of its services, TeamViewer provides a telephone conference number for dialling in as an alternative to the audio conference function of the Software, the provider of the respective telecommunication service (and not TeamViewer) shall be the owner of the telephone connection of the respective number. The use of the telephone conference number shall be subject to a separate fee and is not included in the user fee pursuant to the Contract. If applicable, the invoicing shall be performed by the telephone provider of the participant.




6. Changes to the Software or Services



TeamViewer may change the Software in the context of updates and/or Releases as well as the Server Services (including the system requirements) for good cause. Such good cause shall exist especially if the change is required due to (i) a necessary adaptation required by applicable law, (ii) changes to applicable technical framework conditions (new encryption standards), or (iii) the protection of the system security.




7. Obligations and duties of the Customer



7.1.

Lawful use. The Customer shall use the Software and the Server Services only in accordance with the provisions of the Contract and in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to such use and shall not infringe any third-party rights in connection with such use.

Customer agrees to comply with all relevant laws and will not export, re-export, or transfer any Controlled Technology in contravention of German, EU or U.S. law nor to any restricted country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. Customer further agrees that it will not export, transfer, or sell any Controlled Technology for use in connection with chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, or missiles, drones or space launch vehicles capable of delivering such weapons.

Customer represents that it is not (i) a Restricted Party (as defined below); (ii) currently engaging in any transaction, activity or conduct that could result in a violation of applicable Sanctions (as defined below) and warrants that it will not make available the Controlled Technology directly or indirectly, to, or for the benefit of, any Restricted Party.

Section 7.2 shall only apply to the Customer to the extent that the provisions herein would not result in (i) any violation of, conflict with or liability under EU Regulation (EC) 2271/1996 or (ii) a violation or conflict with section 7 German Foreign Trade Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) or a similar antiboycott statute.

"Restricted Party" means any person (i) designated on any Sanctions List, (ii) that is, or is part of, a governmental authority of a Sanctioned Territory, (iii) owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, any of the foregoing, (iv) located, organized, or resident in, or operating from, a Sanctioned Territory, or (v) otherwise targeted under any Sanctions.

"Sanctions" means economic or financial sanctions or trade embargoes or other comprehensive prohibitions against transaction activity pursuant to anti-terrorism laws or export control laws imposed, administered or enforced from time to time by the US, EU, UN, Germany, or any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported.


7.3.

System requirements. The requirements for the Customer's software and hardware are specified in the manuals and the Product Specification (cf. sections 2.1 and 5.1). The Customer shall familiarize itself with the system requirements prior to using the Software and use the Software in accordance with these system requirements.




8. Confidentiality and data protection



8.1.

Confidentiality. The products offered by TeamViewer, including the Software, the Services and all manuals, data, documentation, and other materials provided by TeamViewer, contain essential components (e.g. algorithm and logic), constituting confidential information and trade secrets and shall be deemed TeamViewer's Confidential Information. Customer will not disclose TeamViewer's Confidential Information to any third party and will use TeamViewer's Confidential Information only in accordance with the Contract.


8.2.

Data protection. TeamViewer strictly complies with applicable data protection law. TeamViewer collects, processes and uses personal data of Customer as controller as set out and in accordance with the Product Privacy Policy available for download under https://www.teamviewer.com/en/privacy-policy/. Additionally, TeamViewer acts as processor for Customer's personal data as set out and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the data processing agreement contained under C.

Non-personal or anonymous data may be collected automatically to improve functionality and the Customers' experience with the Software and the Services. The Customer agrees that TeamViewer owns all rights in and is free to use any such non-personal or anonymous data in any way it deems fit for development, diagnostic, corrective as well as marketing or any other purposes.




9. Limitation of liability



9.1.

Exclusion in certain cases. TeamViewer shall be liable for damages in accordance with the statutory provisions, if such damages



(i)

have been caused by TeamViewer intentionally or grossly negligently, or


(ii)

have been caused by TeamViewer by slight negligence and are due to breaches of duty which jeopardize the fulfilment of the purpose of the Contract, or due to a breach of duties the fulfilment of which would make the proper performance of the Contract possible in the first place and in the fulfilment of which the Customer may trust (breach of material obligations).


Any further liability of TeamViewer shall be excluded irrespective of the legal basis, unless TeamViewer is mandatorily liable in accordance with the law, in particular due to injury to life, body or health of an individual, due to the provision of an express warranty, fraudulent concealment of a defect or due to the provisions of the German Product Liability Act.


9.2.

Limitation of the amount. In the case of section 9.1 sentence 1 (ii) (slightly negligent breach of material obligations), TeamViewer shall only be subject to limited liability for damages that can be typically expected in the case of a contract of this type.


9.3.

Limitation of liability in case of Free Version. In deviation from sections 9.1 and 9.2, TeamViewer's liability for damages caused during a provision and use of Free Version the provisions on lending (section 598 et seq.

3.1.

Non-exclusive right of use. TeamViewer herewith grants the Customer the non-exclusive, worldwide (subject to applicable export regulations; unless the Customer is expressly granted a limited right to use the license only in a specific territory during the order process), non-transferrable and not sub-licensable right to install, run and use the Software on Customer's computers within the limits of the scope of use specified in the Order and/or this EULA. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, Customer shall be entitled to sublicense the Software in accordance with the applicable scope of Software functions (channel grouping).


3.2.

Term of use. In case of a Subscription, the rights of use granted under the Contract shall be limited in time to the term specified in the applicable Order (cf. section 14 below).

The scope of the granted rights and the admissible scope of use (e.g. channels) shall be set forth in the Contract. If the Customer obtains the right to use the Software for commercial use, then the Customer shall be entitled to use the Software for the Customer's own trade or profession or the trade or profession of Customer's Affiliates. For purposes of the foregoing, an "Affiliate" shall mean any other person which directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Customer, including, without limitation, subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. If the Customer obtains a fee-based license that includes the use of the Software and Services by its and/or its Affiliates' employees or representatives, then the Customer shall ensure that any user making use of the Customer's license complies with the terms and conditions of use set forth in this EULA. In case of any non-compliance, the Customer shall be responsible for any such user's acts and/or omissions as for its own actions and/or omissions.


3.4.

Scope of use for Free Version. The use of the Free Version is solely permitted for the Customer's own, private, non-commercial purposes (e.g. free computer support for a spouse/partner). The use of the Free Version for the exercise of the Customer's own trade or profession or the use for purposes for which the Customer directly or indirectly receives compensation (e.g. team work with colleagues, free support provided to third parties which have bought software of the Customer) does not qualify as private use.


3.5.

Unauthorized use. Any use of the Software exceeding the contractually agreed scope of usage is expressly prohibited.


3.6.

Source code. The rights of use granted shall not include any rights to the source code of the Software.


3.7.

Prohibited use. The rights granted pursuant to this EULA shall not include and the Customer shall not be entitled to and shall not allow a third party to (i) attempt to circumvent any technical devices of the Software that are directed at, or have the effect of, enforcing the terms of the EULA; (ii) modify, create derivative works, translate, decompile or create or attempt to create, by reverse engineering or otherwise, the source code or the object code of the Software; (iii) use the Software under any circumstance whatsoever directly or indirectly in a computer service business or service bureau or in a rental or commercial timesharing arrangement or as a spyware; (iv) remove, modify or obscure any copyright, trade secret, confidentiality, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights, serial number, notice, legend or similar on any copy of the Software, or related data, manuals, documentation or other materials; (v) market, sell, lend, rent, lease, or otherwise distribute, the Software or give or provide it to third parties beyond the right to sublicense the Software in accordance with section 3.1 sentence 2; or (vi) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any rights in or to the Software. Customer recognizes and agrees that there is no adequate remedy at law for a breach of this section 3.7 and that such breach would irreparably harm TeamViewer for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that TeamViewer is entitled, in addition to its other rights and remedies, to equitable relief.


3.8.

Reservation of rights. As between the parties, TeamViewer retains all right, title and interest in and to the Software (and any new Versions thereof provided by TeamViewer) and in all copies, modifications and derivative works of the Software including, without limitation, all rights to patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other proprietary or intellectual property rights.


3.9.

Usage analyses, right to audit and self-declaration. TeamViewer may analyse the Customer's use of the Software and Services for security reasons as well as for product improvement, license auditing and/or marketing purposes. To that end, TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, also implement technical measures regarding the functionality of the Software and the Server Services to assess whether the Customer's usage pattern is in line with the indicated usage purpose and thus with the chosen license type and to detect whether the contractually agreed scope of use is being exceeded by the Customer. Also, TeamViewer may require the Customer, at any time, to provide a self-declaration regarding its actual scope of use and/or usage pattern.




4. Services provided by TeamViewer



4.1.

Server Services. For the establishment of encrypted remote communication connections between different users of the Software, the Software must communicate with servers of TeamViewer (so-called "handshake"). In addition, it may be necessary for the transmission of data in the context of a session (e.g. online meeting or remote maintenance) that encrypted data packets be forwarded by servers of TeamViewer (so-called "routing"). Such handshake and routing are made available in connection with TeamViewer's Server Services.

TeamViewer provides the Customer with the Server Services subject to the conditions set out in this EULA. It is not part of the Server Services to safeguard an interruption- and latency-free end-to-end connection between different users of the Software. The Customer acknowledges that the Server Services may be unavailable or include latency from time to time due to technical difficulties or due to causes beyond the reasonable control of TeamViewer. Additionally, the Customer acknowledges that the end-to-end connection between different users of the Software is dependent on the Customer's internet connection to the data center as well as the Customer's use of hardware and software (e.g. PC, operating system) in compliance with system requirements for the Software (pursuant to section 7.4), all of which shall not be included in the services provided by TeamViewer and shall be Customer's responsibility. The respective costs shall be borne by Customer.


4.2.

Support Services. TeamViewer's only obligation for Support Services shall be to provide those specific Support Services set forth and described on the Order (if any), subject to Customer's payment in full for such Support Services.

5.2.

Minor Releases. TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, elect to offer minor releases of the Software for download ("Minor Releases"). The new Software version which contains the Minor Release ("Minor Release Version") may be marked by TeamViewer - in its sole discretion - by a change in the number behind the main version number (e.g. version XX.1, XX.2). Minor Release Versions may contain the correction of errors, security patches as well as minor improvements of functions (e.g. optimizations in the program execution speed) TeamViewer shall have no obligation to provide Minor Release Versions of the Software. If, however, TeamViewer does elect to provide Minor Release Versions of the Software then any Customer shall be obligated by way of a contributory duty to update the Software at its own cost to the then-current Minor Release Version of the Software as soon as reasonably practicable. All rights of use set forth herein that are applicable to the Software shall also apply to Minor Releases.


5.3.

Major Releases. TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, also elect to offer major releases of the Software for download ("Major Releases", Minor Releases and Major Releases, both a "Release"), usually comprising more extensive modifications of the Software functions. The new Software version which contains the Major Release ("Major Release Version", Minor Release Versions and Major Release Versions, both a "Version") may be marked by TeamViewer - in its sole discretion - by a change of the main version number (e.g. version XX, YY). TeamViewer shall not be obligated to provide any Major Release Versions of the Software. In the event that TeamViewer elects to provide a Major Release Version of the Software, TeamViewer may require the Customers of Perpetual licenses to pay an additional fee for use of such new Major Release Version. The Customers of Subscription licenses and Free Version shall be obligated by way of a contributory duty to upgrade to the new Major Release Version as soon as reasonably practicable. All rights of use set forth herein that are applicable to the Software shall also apply to Major Releases.


5.4.

Programming interfaces. At TeamViewer's discretion, the Software or Server Services may provide programming interfaces or other software interfaces ("API") which may include applications of third parties or of the Customer ("Third-party Software") that can communicate with the Software or respectively the servers of TeamViewer. TeamViewer may change or switch off APIs at any time without any obligation or liability to Customer. The respective provider shall be responsible for the Third-party Software. The provisions of the Contract shall not apply to any such Third-party Software and TeamViewer shall have no liability for any Third-party Software.


5.5.

Telephone conference number. If, in the context of its services, TeamViewer provides a telephone conference number for dialling in as an alternative to the audio conference function of the Software, the provider of the respective telecommunication service (and not TeamViewer) shall be the owner of the telephone connection of the respective number. The use of the telephone conference number shall be subject to a separate fee and is not included in the user fee pursuant to the Contract. If applicable, the invoicing shall be performed by the telephone provider of the participant.




6. Changes to the Software or Services.



TeamViewer may change the Software in the context of updates and/or Releases as well as the Server Services (including the system requirements) for good cause.

10. Indemnification



10.1.

Indemnification by Customer. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold TeamViewer, its affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and assigns harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, settlement amounts, and damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by TeamViewer arising out of any suit or proceeding by a third party arising from Customer's use of the Software or Customer's breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Customer under the Contract.


10.2.

Process. TeamViewer shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any action for which TeamViewer believes it is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to section 10.1, as applicable. If TeamViewer is named a party in any judicial, administrative or other proceeding arising out of or in connection of any breach of any provision of this EULA, a negligent or wrongful act, and/or a violation of any applicable law, TeamViewer will have the option at any time to either



(i)

undertake its own defense, choosing the attorneys, consultants, and other appropriate professionals to represent its interests, in which case the Customer will be responsible for and pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such attorneys, consultants, and other professionals or


(ii)

to hand over its defense to the indemnifying party, in which case the indemnifying party will provide qualified attorneys, consultants, and other appropriate professionals to represent the party seeking interests at the Customer's expense. TeamViewer will have the sole right and discretion to settle, compromise or otherwise resolve any and all claims, causes of actions, liabilities or damages against it, notwithstanding that TeamViewer may have tendered its defense to the Customer. Any such resolution will not relieve the party of its obligation to indemnify the other party under this section 10.

11.1.

Changes to the EULA. TeamViewer shall be entitled to amend this EULA upon no less than four (4) weeks prior notice to Customer. Unless Customer notifies TeamViewer in writing of its objection to such amendment within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of notice of such amendment from TeamViewer then the amendment shall be deemed accepted by Customer. If, on the other hand, Customer notifies TeamViewer in writing of its objection to such amendment within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of notice of such amendment from TeamViewer then the Contract shall be continued under the existing terms without giving effect to such amendment.

11.5.

Severability; waiver. If any provision of the Contract is found partly or wholly illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and remaining provisions of the Contract shall remain in full force and effect.

Warranty. TeamViewer warrants that during the term of any Subscription, the Software and Server Services will conform, in all material respects, with the applicable Product Specification. TeamViewer does not warrant that it will be able to correct all reported defects or that use of the Software and Server Services will be uninterrupted or error free. TeamViewer makes no warranty regarding features or services provided by third parties. For any breach of the above warranty, TeamViewer will, at no additional cost to Customer, provide remedial services necessary to enable the Software and Server Services to conform to the warranty. Customer will provide TeamViewer with a reasonable opportunity to remedy any breach and reasonable assistance in remedying any defects. Such re-performance shall be Customer's exclusive remedy and TeamViewer's sole liability for any breach of said warranty. If, however, after repeated efforts, TeamViewer is unable to remedy such defect in any Software or Server Services, then Customer's sole remedy and TeamViewer's entire liability shall be to terminate the Contract in which case TeamViewer will refund to Customer any prepaid, unused amounts (if any) previously paid by Customer to TeamViewer for the Software and Server Services applicable to the unexpired portion of the remainder of the term of the Subscription. The above warranty specifically excludes defects resulting from accident, abuse, unauthorized repair, modifications or enhancements, or misapplication. THE FOREGOING IS CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR TEAMVIEWER'S BREACH OF THIS WARRANTY.


13.2.

Restrictions. The limited obligation pursuant to section 13.1. above does not include the right to (i) any adaptation of the Software to new operating systems or new operating system versions, (ii) the adaptation of the Software to the scope of functions of competing products, (iii) the establishment of compatibility with new data formats or Releases (cf. sections 5.2 and 5.3) or (iv) the provision of any functionality which is no longer supported by TeamViewer.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 13 ARE CUSTOMER'S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. TEAMVIEWER MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ANY SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT OPERATION OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER WARRANTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.




14. Term and termination in case of Subscription



14.1.

Term and ordinary termination. Unless otherwise specified in the Order, the Contract has an initial term of twelve (12) months ("Initial Term") and shall subsequently be renewed automatically for additional periods of twelve (12) months (each a "Renewal Term"), unless either party notifies the other party no less than twenty eight (28) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term that it has elected not to renew the Contract.

The Customer shall be solely responsible for exporting the data - as far as possible - prior to the termination or expiration of the term of the Contract by means of the Software functions and to store it for further use. TeamViewer shall not be obligated to any further release of data. Upon termination or expiration of the Contract, TeamViewer shall delete the Customer's data that is processed for the purpose of performance of the Contract, unless TeamViewer is obligated by law to store it.

Part IV
Supplementary provisions regarding Free Version



17. Product Specification in case of Free Version.

A key element of and part of the Product Specification for the Free Version is the display and receipt of personalized marketing messages in the Software as well as the processing of personal data necessary to provide such personalization.

TeamViewer permits the Customer to use the Free Version as an unregistered user without setting up a TeamViewer account. As part of the Product Specification for the Free Version, TeamViewer may set limits for an unregistered user and, upon such limits being reached, require the Customer to set up a TeamViewer account for further use of the Free Version.




18. Server Services in case of Free Version.

In case of Free Version, the Customer has no claim to demand the provision of the Server Services and TeamViewer may in its sole discretion discontinue or modify the Server Services at any time.




19. Term and termination in case of Free Version.



The Contract shall enter into effect upon its conclusion and be concluded for an unlimited period of time. Either party may terminate the Contract at any time without giving reasons or notice.

If the Customer wishes to opt-out of receiving personalized marketing messages, any such declaration shall be interpreted as a termination of the Contract and the Customer shall have no right to use the Free Version thereafter. If, however, the Customer continues to use the Free Version after providing such a declaration, the continued use shall be understood as acceptance of and be governed by the terms of this EULA (including, for the avoidance of doubt, section 17 above).

Either party's right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected. Sections 14.3 and 14.4 shall apply accordingly.

2.2.

Processing on Instructions Only. To the extent this DPA is applicable, TeamViewer shall only process personal data on documented instructions from the Customer mutually agreed by the parties in the EULA and the Order.

All costs incurred insofar shall be borne by the Customer and shall be refunded at an hourly rate of 70 Euro to the extent permissible under applicable data protection law.

TeamViewer shall make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations resulting from clauses 2 and 3.

If TeamViewer would like to engage additional or different Subprocessors to render the contractually agreed services, such Subprocessors shall be selected using the due care required by law. TeamViewer shall give the Customer prior notice of the appointment of any new Subprocessors 15 days in advance. The Customer may object against the instruction of the new Subprocessors on reasonable grounds.
